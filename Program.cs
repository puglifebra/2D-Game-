        // George,
        // You've clearly spent a **ton** of time working on this project so far.
        // Great job! These methods are not 100% BUT I think you're ready to start 
        // by setting up a Unity project to be able to start working.
        //
        // Today in class most other students will be working on writing tests. However,
        // I think it is important for you to get your Unity project set up.
        // Do your best in class today to get a Unity project added to this repository.
        // 
        // Looking forward to seeing your work!
